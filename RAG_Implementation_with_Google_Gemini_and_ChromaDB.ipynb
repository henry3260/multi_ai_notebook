If you want to learn Python\\nprogramming for data science, machine learning, or\\nweb development, this Python\\ntutorial is the perfect place to learn Python. You\\ndon't need any prior knowledge in Python\\nor programming in general, I'm going to teach you\\neverything from scratch\\nI'm Mosh Hamadani, and I've taught millions of people\\nhow to code through this channel\\nIf you're new here, make sure to subscribe as I\\nupload new videos every week. Now\\nlet's jump in and get started. Alright, before we get\\nstarted, let me give you some\\nideas about what you can do with Python. That's a\\nvery common question\\nPython is a multipurpose programming language, so you\\ncan use it for a variety of different tasks\\nYou can use Python for machine learning and AI. In\\nfact, Python is the number\\none language for machine learning and data science\\nprojects. Python is also very\\npopular in web development. Using Python and a\\nframework called Django\\nyou can build amazing websites. Here are five\\nwebsites powered with Python and Django\\n\\nYouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, and Pinterest\\nYou can also use Python in automation. With Python\\nyou can save your time\\nand increase your productivity by automating\\nrepetitive tasks\\nSo, why are you learning Python? Are you learning it\\nfor automation, for data science\\nor web development? Let me know in the comments\\nsection below\\nAlright, the first thing I want you to do is to head\\nover to python.org to download\\nthe latest version of Python. So you go to downloads\\nand select\\nthe latest version of Python\\nHere in your downloads folder, you should see this\\npackage, simply\\ndouble click it, you're going to see this Python\\ninstaller\\nif you're on Windows, you will see this check box\\nover here, add Python to\\npath. Make sure to check it, it's really important,\\notherwise you're not\\ngoing to be able to follow this tutorial. Simply\\nclick on continue\\nagain, one more time, agree with the terms\\n\\nand install the latest version of Python\\nNow here you need to enter the username and password\\nof your computer, so\\nlet's do that real quick\\nNext you need to install a code editor. We use a code\\neditor to\\nwrite our code and execute it. The most popular code\\neditor for Python is\\nPyCharm. You can get it from jetbrains.com\\nSo on this page, click on\\ndownload, you should see two different editions, one\\nis\\nthe professional edition which is commercial, and we\\nalso have this community\\nedition which is free and open source. So we're going\\nto download the community\\nedition\\nNow in your downloads folder, you should have this\\npackage, let's double click it\\nif you're on Windows, you're going to see an\\ninstallation\\nwizard, so simply click on the next button until you\\ninstall PyCharm\\nIf you're on a Mac, you need to drag this PyCharm and\\ndrop it onto\\n\\nthe applications folder\\nNow, let's open it, the first time you open\\nPyCharm, you have to configure a few settings. We\\ndon't want to spend time on this\\nso over here, you're going to click on skip remaining\\nand set\\ndefaults. Now let's create a new project\\nover here we can specify the location and the name of\\nour\\npython project. So, let's append hello world\\nto this path. This is where our python project is\\ngoing to be saved\\nSo, let's click on create\\nin this window you can see the content of our\\nproject, so\\nhere's our hello world project, currently we have\\nonly one folder inside this project\\nthat is vn, which is short for virtual environment,\\nwe'll talk about virtual\\nenvironments in the future. So currently we don't\\nhave any python files inside\\nthis project. A real application can consist of tens\\nor hundreds\\nor even thousands of python files. So, let's right\\nclick on the project\\n\\nname, and go to new python file\\nwe're going to call this file app\\nNow we can collapse this project window by clicking\\non this icon. So now we have\\nmore space, let's write our first python code. We're\\ngoing to write print\\nall in lower case, then add parenthesis, then add\\nquotes, either single quotes or double quotes\\nAnd inside these quotes we're going to write hello\\nworld. So this is what\\nwe call a string. A string means a string or sequence\\nof\\ncharacters. In simple words, that means textual data.\\nSo in\\npython and in many other programming languages,\\nwhenever we're dealing with\\ntextual data, we should always surround our text with\\nquotes\\nIn python we can use single or double quotes\\nNow this print you see here is a function built into\\npython, and we can\\nuse it to print a message on our application window.\\nSo let me show you\\nhow to run this code. On the top, we go to the run\\nmenu\\n\\nand then select run. Note that there is a shortcut\\nassociated\\nwith this command, I always use shortcuts because\\nthey increase my productivity\\nSo, let's click on this, now select app\\nand over here, you can see this little window, this\\nis what we call\\nthe terminal window, and it shows the output of our\\nprogram\\nSo here's the hello world message printed in the\\nterminal window. Now as you learn\\nmore python, you will learn how to build applications\\nthat have a graphical user\\ninterface. That's an advanced topic, so for now,\\nlet's not worry about it\\nAlright, now let's talk about variables\\nWe use variables to temporarily store data in a\\ncomputer's memory\\nFor example, we can store the price of a product, or\\nsomeone's name\\ntheir email, their age, and so on. Let me show you.\\nSo\\nto declare a variable, we start by typing a name for\\nthat variable\\nLet's say age, then we add an equal sign\\nand then we type a value, let's say 20. So with this\\n\\nwe're storing the\\nnumber 20 somewhere in our computer's memory, and\\nwe're attaching this\\nage as a label for that memory location. So now we\\ncan read the\\nvalue at this memory location, and print it on the\\nterminal. So\\ninstead of printing hello world, we want to print the\\nvalue of the age\\nvariable. So I'm going to delete what we have inside\\nparenthesis\\nand type age. Note that I'm not adding\\nquotes, because if I run this program, we'll see the\\ntext age\\non the terminal. We don't want that, we want the\\nvalue of the age variable\\nSo, let's remove the quotes, and\\nprint the value of the age variable. Now here on the\\ntoolbar, you can click\\non this play icon to run your program, or you can use\\nthe shortcut that I\\nshowed you in the last video. So, the shortcut is\\nover here\\nOn a Mac, that's control shift and r. So\\nthere you go, now you can see the value of the age\\n\\nvariable. Now we can also change the value of a\\nvariable\\nFor example, on line 2, we can set age to\\n30, now when we run our program, we see 30\\nSo as you can see, our program gets executed from top\\nto bottom\\nSo this is how we can declare and use a variable. Now\\nlet's look at\\na few more examples. So, I'm going to declare another\\nvariable\\ncalled price, and set it to 19.95\\nSo in Python we can use numbers with a decimal point,\\nor\\nwhole numbers. We can also declare a variable and\\nassign it a string value. So, let's say first\\nunderline name. So if you want to use multiple words\\nin the name\\nof a variable, we should separate them using an\\nunderscore. This makes\\nour code more readable. See what would happen if I\\ndidn't use this\\nunderline. This is not easily readable. So, we always\\nseparate multiple words by an underscore. Now we set\\nthis to a string. So we can use single quotes or\\ndouble quotes\\n\\nLet's say mosh. We also have a special type of value\\ncalled\\na boolean value which can be true or false. That is\\nlike\\nyes or no in English. Let me show you. So, I'm going\\nto\\ndeclare another variable called is online, and\\nset it to true. We can also set it to false\\nWhat we have here is called a boolean value. Now note\\nthat\\nPython is a case sensitive language, so it's\\nsensitive to lower case and\\nupper case letters. In this case, if I use a lower\\ncase f\\nyou can see an error over here, because this is not\\nrecognized\\nin Python. So false with a capital f is a special\\nkeyword in Python that represents the boolean false\\nvalue\\nSo this is how we can declare and use variables in\\nPython\\nAlright, now here's a little exercise for you.\\nImagine you want to write a program\\nfor a hospital. So we're going to check in a patient\\nnamed John Smith\\n\\nhe's 20 years old, and he's a new patient. I want you\\nto declare a few\\nvariables to store these values. Use the comment box\\nbelow to share\\nyour code with others\\nIn this\\ntutorial, I'm going to show you how to receive input\\nfrom the user. So in Python\\nwe have another built in function called input, we\\nuse this to\\nread a value from the terminal window. Let me show\\nyou. So, we add\\nparenthesis, then we type a string, here we can type\\na message\\nlike what is your name? We add a question mark\\nfollowed by a space. You will see why we need this\\nspace in a second. So\\nlet's run this program, we get this message, now we\\nhave\\nto enter a value. So, we click over here, now you can\\nsee that the\\ncaret is separated from the question mark, this is\\nbecause of the white space\\nthat we added over here. So now, we have to type a\\nvalue, let's say\\nJohn, when we press enter, this function\\n\\nwill return the value that we entered in the terminal\\nwindow. So we can\\nget that value and store it in a variable. So, let's\\ndeclare a variable\\ncalled name, and set it to the return value of the\\ninput function. Now we can print a greeting message\\nfor this user\\nSo, we use the print function, we say\\nhello, we add a space, now after the string\\nwe want to add the value of the name variable. So, we\\nuse a\\nplus sign, and then type name. What we are doing here\\nis called\\nstring concatenation. So we're combining this string\\nwith\\nanother string. Now let's run our program and see\\nwhat happens\\nSo, what is your name? Mosh, now\\nwe get this message. Hello Mosh. So this is how we\\ncan use the input function\\nin Python\\nYou'll learn about the three\\ntypes of data in Python. We have numbers, strings\\nand booleans. Now there are times you want to convert\\n\\nthe value of a\\nvariable from one type to another. Let me show you.\\nSo, we're going to\\nuse our input function to read the user's birth year\\nSo, enter your birth year\\nNow this input function is going to return a value\\nso we can store it in a variable called birth\\nunderline\\nyear. Okay, now let's write code to calculate\\nthe age of this user. So, we write an expression like\\nthis. Currently\\nwe are in the year 2020, so 2020 minus\\nbirth year, this expression or piece of code is going\\nto produce\\na value, so once again we can store that value in a\\nvariable. Let's call\\nthat variable age. Now let's print age\\non the terminal. Let's run our program and see what\\nhappens\\nSo, my birth year is 1982\\nenter, oops, our program crashed. So whenever you see\\nthis red\\nmessage, that indicates an error, so this error\\noccurred in this\\n\\nfile, that is our app.py on line 2\\nRight below that you can see the piece of code that\\ngenerated\\nthis error. So that is this expression, 2020 minus\\nbirth year\\nNow below that you can see the type of error, so here\\nwe have\\nunsupported types or subtraction\\nWe have int and str. What are these?\\nWell this int is short for integer and that\\nrepresents a whole number\\nin programming. So, 2020 is\\nan example of an integer. Now birth year is an\\nexample of a\\nstring, because whenever we call the input function,\\nthis function\\nwill return a value as a string, even if we enter a\\nnumber\\nIn other words, when I entered 1982, this input\\nfunction\\nreturned a string with these characters, 1982\\nSo this string is different from the number 1982\\nThey're completely different types. So in this case,\\nlet me delete\\nthese lines, the reason we got this error is that we\\n\\ntried to\\nsubtract a string from an integer. So our code looks\\nlike this\\n1982. Now Python doesn't know\\nhow to subtract a string from an integer. So, to\\nsolve this problem\\nwe need to convert this string to an integer. Now in\\nPython\\nwe have a bunch of built in functions for converting\\nthe types of our variables\\nso we have this int function, we can\\npass our birth year to it, and this will return the\\nnumeric\\nrepresentation of the birth year. So, to solve this\\nproblem\\nwe need to replace the string\\nwith an int function. So let's see what's going on\\nhere\\nOn the first line, we call the input function, this\\nreturns a string\\non the second line, we pass the string to our int\\nfunction\\nthe int function will return the numeric\\nrepresentation of the birth year\\nThen, we subtract it from 2020, we get the age\\n\\nand store it in the age variable. Now let's run our\\nprogram\\nso, 1982, and there you go\\nI'm 38 years old. So this is how the int function\\nworks\\nNow we also have another built in function called\\nfloat\\nthat is for converting a value to a floating point\\nnumber. A floating\\npoint number in Python and other programming\\nlanguages is a number\\nwith a decimal point. So, 10 is an integer\\nand 10.1 is a float. So, we have int\\nwe have float, and we also have bool, for converting\\na value to a boolean, and finally we have stir\\nfor converting a value to a string. So these are the\\nbuilt in functions\\nfor converting the type of our variables. Now here's\\na little\\nexercise for you. I want you to write a basic\\ncalculator program\\nSo here we have to enter two numbers, we can type a\\nwhole number or a number\\nwith a decimal point, and then our program will print\\nthe sum of these two numbers. So pause the video,\\n\\nspend two minutes on this\\nexercise, and then see my solution\\nAlright, first we're going to call our input function\\nto read\\nthe first number, we get the result and store it in a\\nvariable called\\nfirst. Now, let's declare another variable\\ncalled second, and read the second number\\nNow, we calculate the sum\\nso that is first plus second, now let's see what\\nhappens\\nwhen we print sum on the terminal. So I enter\\n10 and 20, but instead of 30 we get 10\\n20, this is because we're combining or concatenating\\ntwo strings\\nSo, as I told you before, the input\\nfunction returns a string, so this line\\nwill be equivalent to first equals 10. You're dealing\\nwith a string, not an integer. Similarly\\nsecond is going to be 20 as a string, so when we\\ncombine\\ntwo strings, 10 plus 20 will get\\n10 20, because we're dealing with textual data. Okay?\\n\\nSo to solve this problem, we need to convert the\\nvalues we read to their numeric representation. So,\\nover here\\nwe're going to pass first to our int function\\nand here as well, now let's run our program\\nso we enter 10 and 20, we get 30\\nWhat if we enter a floating point number, so 10.1\\nand 20. You got an error\\nSo, to solve this problem, we need to treat\\nboth these values as floats, so instead of the int\\nfunction\\nwe're going to use the float function, now\\nlet's run our program one more time, we enter a whole\\nnumber\\nand a floating point number. So the result is\\ncorrect, now\\nlet's add a label over here, so sum\\nis plus sum. Let's run our program\\none more time, 10 and 20, once again, we got an error\\nThe error is saying that Python can only concatenate\\nstrings, not floats to strings. So on line 4\\nwe have a string, we're concatenating this\\n\\nwith a float, because the result of this expression\\nis a floating point number\\nWe're adding two floats, so the result is a float as\\nwell\\nSo Python doesn't know how to evaluate code like this\\nIt doesn't know how to concatenate a float\\nto a string. To solve this problem\\nwe need to convert sum to a string. So this is where\\nwe use the stir function. Now, let's run the program\\nagain, so 10 plus 20.1 and\\nhere's the result. And one last thing, in this\\nexample\\nI'm calling the float function at the time we want to\\ncalculate the sum of these two\\nnumbers, but this is not a requirement. We can call\\nthe float function\\nover here. So this input function returns a\\nstring, we can pass that string to our float\\nfunction. Take a look\\nSo float, parenthesis, like this. So\\nthe value that we're passing to the float function is\\nthe value that is returned\\nfrom the input function. Similarly\\n\\nwe call the float function over here, now\\nwe can change this expression to first plus second\\nThat is another way to write this piece of code. So\\ntype\\nconversion is important in Python and other\\nprogramming languages, there are times\\nyou need to convert the type of variable to a\\ndifferent type\\nIn this tutorial, I'm going to show you a bunch of\\ncool things you can do with\\nstrings in Python. So let's start by declaring a\\nvariable called\\ncourse, and set it to Python for beginners\\nNow this string that we have over here is technically\\nan\\nobject. An object in Python is like an object in the\\nreal world\\nAs a metaphor, think of the remote control of your\\ntv. This remote control\\nis an object, and it has a bunch of capabilities. It\\nhas a bunch of buttons for\\nturning your tv on, turning it off, changing the\\nvolume and so on\\nNow in this program, this course variable is storing\\na string object\\nThis string object has a bunch of capabilities. So if\\n\\nyou type\\ncourse dot, you can see all the capabilities\\navailable\\nin a string object. These are basically functions\\nthat you can call. Just like\\nthe print or input functions. The difference is that\\nthe print and input\\nfunctions are general purpose functions. They don't\\nbelong to a particular object\\nBut the functions you see over here are specific to\\nstrings\\nNow more accurately, we refer to these as methods. So\\nwhen\\na function is part of an object, we refer to that\\nfunction as a method\\nSo, let's look at a few examples. Here we have a\\nfunction or\\na method called upper, and we use that to convert a\\nstring to uppercase\\nSo if we print course dot upper\\nand run this program, you can see our course in\\nuppercase\\nPretty useful. Now what you need to understand here,\\nis that this upper method\\ndoes not change our original string, it will return a\\nnew string\\n\\nSo right after this, if we print course\\nyou can see that our course variable is not affected\\nSo the upper method returns a new string\\nSimilarly we have another method called lower, for\\nconverting\\na string to lower case. We have a method called find,\\nto see if our\\nstring contains a character or a sequence of\\ncharacters. For example\\nhere we can pass y, and this will return\\nthe index of the first occurrence of y in our string.\\nSo\\nin Python, the index of the first character in our\\nstring\\nis 0. So here we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. So\\nwhen we run this\\nprogram, you're going to see 1 on the terminal,\\nbecause the index of\\ny is 1. Take a look. First I'm going to delete this\\nline\\nwe don't need it anymore, also, let's delete this\\nline\\nlet's run the program, there you go. Now as\\nI told you before, Python is sensitive to lower case\\nand uppercase letters\\n\\nso if I pass an uppercase y here\\nthis find method returns negative 1, because we\\ndon't have an uppercase y in this string. We can also\\npass a sequence\\nof characters, for example 4, so this will return the\\nindex of the word 4. Take a look. So it's\\n7. Now there are times you want to replace something\\nin a string with\\nsomething else. To do that we use the replace method\\nReplace. So we can replace 4 with\\na string containing the number 4. Take a look\\nSo Python for beginners. Obviously\\nif you look for a character or a sequence of\\ncharacters that don't exist in our string\\nnothing is going to happen. For example, if you try\\nto replace x with\\n4, obviously we don't have x here, so nothing is\\ngoing to\\nhappen. Also, just like the upper method, the replace\\nmethod is not going to modify our original string, so\\nit's going to return\\na new string. This is because strings in Python and\\nmany other\\nprogramming languages are immutable. We cannot change\\n\\nthem once we create them\\nWhenever we want to change a string, we'll end up\\nwith a new string object in\\nmemory. Now one last thing I want to cover in this\\ntutorial. There are times you want to\\nsee if your string contains a character or a sequence\\nof characters\\nOne way to do that is using the find method that we\\ntalked about\\nso let's see if our string contains Python\\nNow when we run this program, that is the index\\nof the first occurrence of the word Python in our\\nstring. Now in\\nPython we can also use the in operator. So we can\\nwrite an expression\\nlike this. We type a string, Python\\nthen we type in, this is a special keyword in Python\\nthis is what we call the in operator, so after that\\nwe type the name of our variable. So with this\\nexpression\\nwe're checking to see if we have Python in course\\nAs you can see, Python code is very readable, it's\\nlike plain English. So\\nwhen we run this program, instead of seeing the index\\nof the first\\n\\noccurrence of Python, we see a boolean value. This is\\nmore desirable in\\na lot of cases. Next we're going to look at\\narithmetic operations\\nIn this tutorial, I'm going to show you the\\narithmetic operators that we have in Python\\nThese are the same arithmetic operators that we have\\nin math. For example, we can\\nadd numbers, we can subtract them, multiply them and\\nso on. So let's\\nprint 10 plus 3, when we run this program\\nwe get 13. So this is the addition operator\\nWe also have subtraction, we have multiplication, and\\ndivision. Now technically we have two different types\\nof division operators\\nWe have a division with one slash and another with\\ntwo slashes\\nLet's look at the differences. If you use a single\\nslash\\nwe get a floating point number, that is a number with\\na decimal point\\nbut if you use double slashes, we get an integer\\na whole number. We also have the modulus operator\\nthat is indicated by a percent sign, and this returns\\nthe\\n\\nremainder of the division of 10 by 3. So, that is\\n1. And finally we have the exponent operator that is\\nindicated\\nby 2 asterisks. So this is 10 to the power of 3\\nSo when we run this, we get 1000. Now\\nfor all these operators that you saw, we have an\\naugmented assignment\\noperator. Let me explain what it means. So, let's say\\nwe have a variable\\ncalled x, and we set it to 10. Now we want to\\nincrement the value of x by 3. So we have to write\\ncode like this\\nx equals x plus 3. When Python executes\\nthis code, it's going to evaluate this expression or\\nthis piece of code\\nthe result of this expression is 10 plus 3 which is\\n13. Then it will\\nstore 13 in the x. Now there is another way\\nto achieve the same result using less code. We can\\ntype x\\nplus equal 3. What we have on line 3 is\\nexactly identical to what we have on line 2. So what\\nwe have here is called\\nthe augmented assignment operator. So we have this\\n\\nassignment\\noperator, but we have augmented or enhanced it\\nNow here we can also use subtraction to decrease the\\nvalue\\nof x by 3, we can use multiplication and so on\\nSo these are the arithmetic operators in Python\\nAlright, let me ask you a question. I'm going to\\ndeclare a variable called x\\nand set it to 10 plus 3 times 2. What do you think\\nis the result of this expression? This is a basic\\nmath question that unfortunately\\na lot of people fail to answer. The answer is 16\\nHere's the reason. In math we have this concept\\ncalled operator\\nprecedence, and that determines the order in which\\nthese operators\\nare applied. So multiplication and division have a\\nhigher\\norder, so this part of the expression gets evaluated\\nfirst, so 2 times\\n3 is 6, and then the result is added to 10\\nThat is why the result of this expression is 16. Now\\nin Python\\noperator precedence is exactly like math, but we can\\nalways change it using\\n\\nparenthesis. For example, in this expression, if you\\nwant 10 plus 3\\nto be evaluated first, we can wrap it in parenthesis\\nSo, like this. Now when we execute this code\\nwe're going to see 26, because 10 plus 3 is 13\\nand that divided by 2 is 26. Let's verify this. So\\nprint x\\nand we get 26\\nSo you learned about the arithmetic operators in\\nPython. Now in\\nPython we have another set of operators called\\ncomparison operators\\nWe use these operators to compare values. Let me show\\nyou\\nSo, I'm going to declare a variable called x, and set\\nit to an expression like this\\n3 is greater than 2. So what we have here\\nthis piece of code, this expression is called a\\nboolean expression\\nbecause it produces a boolean value. So in this case,\\nbecause 3 is\\ngreater than 2, the result of this expression is the\\nboolean true\\nSo, if we print x\\n\\nwe get true on the terminal. So here's the greater\\nthan operator\\nWe also have greater than or equal to, we have\\nless than, we have less than or equal to, here's the\\nequality operator, which is indicated by two equal\\nsigns, do not\\nconfuse this with the assignment operator. So here\\nwe're comparing 3\\nand 2 for equality. So if we run our program\\nwe see false, because 3 does not equal to 2\\nSo here's the equality operator, we also have the not\\nequality\\noperator, that is indicated by an exclamation mark,\\nfollowed\\nby an equal sign. So, let's quickly recap. Here are\\nthe\\ncomparison operators we have in Python. Greater than,\\ngreater\\nthan or equal to, less than, less than or equal to,\\nequal\\nand not equal. These operators are extremely\\nimportant in\\nreal Python programs, because quite often we have to\\ncompare values\\nto evaluate certain conditions. You're going to see\\nthat soon\\n\\nIn Python\\nwe have another set of operators called logical\\noperators\\nWe use these operators to build complex rules and\\nconditions\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to declare a variable\\ncalled price, and set it to\\n25. Now let's print a boolean expression like this\\nPrice is greater than 10. Now let's\\nsay we want to check to see if the price is between\\n10 and 30\\nThis is where we use the logical and operator. So we\\ntype\\nand, and right after that we type another boolean\\nexpression\\nSo price less than 30. So with this and operator\\nif both these boolean expressions return true, the\\nresult\\nof this entire expression will be true. Take a look.\\nSo\\nin this case we get true, because the price is\\nbetween\\n10 and 30 dollars. We also have the or operator\\nWith the or operator, if at least one of these\\nboolean\\n\\nexpressions returns true, then the result of this\\nentire expression will be\\ntrue. To demonstrate this, I'm going to change price\\nto 5. Let's see how Python is going to execute this\\ncode. So first it's\\ngoing to look at this boolean expression. Is price\\ngreater than 10?\\nNo it's not, so it will keep going. Then it will look\\nat the second\\nboolean expression. Is price less than 30? It sure is\\nso the result of this entire expression will be true.\\nTake a look\\nThere you go. We also have the not operator\\nwhich basically inverses any values that you give it.\\nLet me show you. So\\nwe're going to have one boolean expression\\nprice greater than 10. The result of this expression\\nis false\\nNow if you apply the not operator, this will inverse\\nfalse to true. So, when we run the program we get\\ntrue\\nSo let's quickly recap. In Python we have 3\\nlogical operators. We have logical and, which returns\\ntrue if both\\n\\nexpressions return true, we have logical or, which\\nreturns\\ntrue if at least one expression returns true, and we\\nhave\\nnot, which inverses any value that we give it\\nIn this tutorial\\nwe're going to talk about if statements in Python. We\\nuse if statements\\nto make decisions in our programs. For example, we\\ncan declare a variable\\ncalled temperature, and depending on the value of\\nthis variable, we can\\nprint different messages on the terminal. Let me show\\nyou. So, here's our\\ntemperature variable, we set it to 35. Now let's say\\nif temperature is greater than 30, we want to print a\\nmessage saying\\nit's a hot day. So we type if, then we type a\\ncondition, and this is where we use our comparison\\noperators. So we type\\ntemperature greater than 30. Then\\nso we add a colon, and see what happens when I press\\nenter now\\nThe character is indented, and this represents a\\nblock\\n\\nof code. So the code that we write over here will be\\nexecuted\\nif this condition is true. Otherwise, it's not going\\nto be executed. Let me show you\\nSo, we're going to print\\nit's a hot day, and by the way, note that here I've\\nsurrounded\\nthe string with double quotes, because here we have a\\nsingle\\nquote as an apostrophe. So I couldn't declare a\\nstring like this\\nWith single quotes. If I type it's a hot day\\nlook, Python gets confused. Because it thinks this\\nsingle\\nquote represents the end of our string, so it doesn't\\nrecognize the subsequent\\ncharacters. So that's why we use double\\nquotes here, so we can have an apostrophe in our\\nstring\\nSo it's a hot day. Now if I press enter again\\nthe character is indented, so the code that we write\\nhere\\nwill be part of our if block, and it will get\\nexecuted if this condition\\nis true. So here we can print a second message\\n\\ndrink plenty of water. Now to terminate this block\\nwe press enter, and then press shift and tab\\nThe character is no longer indented, so the code that\\nwe write here\\nwill always get executed no matter what. Whether this\\ncondition is true\\nor not. Now in C based programming languages like C++\\nC sharp, Java, and JavaScript, we present a block of\\ncode using curly braces. So, you start a block\\nof code using a left brace, and then end it using a\\nright brace\\nIn Python we don't have curly braces. So we use\\nindentation to\\nrepresent a block of code. So, in this\\ncase, these two lines are indented, and that means\\nthey are\\npart of this block of code. Now, let's run the\\nprogram and see what\\nhappens. So we see these two messages because the\\ntemperature is\\ngreater than 30. Now, if I change the temperature\\nto 25, and run the program again, we don't see\\nanything. Now, after this block\\nlet's print done. Because this code is not indented\\n\\nit will always get executed. It's not part of our if\\nblock\\nSo, take a look. Here's the done message\\nNow, let's add a second condition. So if temperature\\nis not greater than 30, that means it's less than or\\nequal\\nto 30. So, I'm going to add a second condition\\nso if the temperature is between 20 and 30, I want to\\nprint it's a\\nnice day. So here we type elif\\nthat is short for else if, and here we type a second\\ncondition\\nSo temperature greater than 20\\nWe add a colon, press enter, now we have a new block\\nSo here we can print, it's a nice day\\nSo if this condition is true, that means the\\ntemperature is greater than 20 and less than\\nor equal to 30. Now what we have here is called a\\ncomment\\nthat is why it's grayed out. It's not real code, it's\\njust some note that we add to our\\nprogram. Python is not going to execute this. So\\nwhenever we type a\\n\\npound sign, what we have after is treated as a\\ncomment\\nSo, if this condition is true, then we're going to\\nsee\\nthis message on the terminal. Let's run our program\\nand verify this\\nThere you go, the temperature is 25, that's why we\\nsee this\\nmessage. Now we can have as many conditions as we\\nwant, there are no\\nlimitations, okay? So let's add another condition\\nElif, temperature is greater than 10\\nthen we're going to print, it's a bit cold\\nNow in this case, if this condition is true, that\\nmeans\\nthe temperature is greater than 10 and less than or\\nequal to 20\\nNow finally if the temperature is less than 10, let's\\nprint a message saying it's a cold day. So, here we\\ntype\\nelse, then we add a colon, and now we have a new\\nblock\\nSo, this code will get executed if none of the above\\nconditions are true. So, here we can print\\nit's cold. So this is how\\n\\nwe use if statements to make decisions in our\\nprograms\\nHere's a great exercise for you to practice what you\\nhave learned so far\\nI want you to write a weight converter program like\\nthis\\nSo this program is asking me my weight, I enter 170\\nNext it's asking me if the weight is in kilograms or\\npounds. So I can type k for kilograms or l for pounds\\nI can type a lower case l or an upper case l, it\\ndoesn't matter\\nSo let's go with a lower case l. Now it tells me\\nweight in kilogram is 76.5\\nSo go ahead and spend 5 minutes on this exercise, you\\ncan use the comment box below\\nto share your code with others, and then when you're\\ndone come back and see my solution\\nSo first we call our input function to ask the first\\nquestion\\nWeight. We get the result and store it in a variable\\ncalled\\nweight. Next we call the input function one more time\\nto\\nask the second question. Is this in kilogram or\\n\\npounds? We get the\\nresult and store it in a variable called unit, this\\nis where we're going to\\nuse an if statement. So, we want to check to see if\\nunit\\nequals k. Then\\nwe should convert the weight to pounds and print it\\non a terminal. However\\nwith this code, if I type a lower case k, this\\ncondition is not\\ngoing to be true. Because earlier I told you that\\npython is a case sensitive language\\nSo, we need to convert this string to upper case\\nEarlier we talked about string methods. So if you\\ntype dot\\nwe can see all the functions or methods available in\\na string object\\nSo we use the upper method, and this returns a new\\nstring\\nin upper case. Now, if this condition is true, first\\nwe need to convert the weight to pounds. So we\\ndeclare a new variable called\\nconvert it, get the weight, and divide it by\\n0.45. And then we can print this\\non a terminal. So, we say weight\\n\\nin pounds is, then we append convert it\\nNow, to terminate this block, we press shift and tab\\nelse colon, so if this condition is not\\ntrue, that means the weight was entered in pounds, so\\nwe need to convert it to\\nkilograms. Once again, we declare a variable, convert\\nit\\nand set it to weight times 0.45\\nAnd then we print weight in kilograms\\nand here we concatenate\\nthis string with converted. Alright, now we need to\\nterminate this block\\nso we press enter, then shift and tab, good\\nNow if we run this program, we're going to see an\\nerror, let me show you. So, let's run\\nit, here I'm going to enter 170, then I\\ntype a lower case l, okay, here's an error\\nCan't multiply sequence by non int of type float\\nSo this is where we got this error. When we try to\\nmultiply the weight by 0.45. So\\nthat is line 7 in our code. Now, the reason this is\\nhappening\\n\\nis because the weight variable is storing a string\\nobject\\nBecause earlier I told you, the input function always\\nreturns a string\\nSo here we need to convert the weight to a number\\nWe can either use the int or the float function.\\nLet's run\\nthe program one more time. So, 170\\nin pounds, here's a second error\\nCan only concatenate string, not float to string\\nAnd that error occurred over here\\nWhen we tried to print the weight in kilograms. So\\nlook at line 7. In this case, weight is an integer,\\nwe are\\nmultiplying an integer by a float, and the result of\\nthis operation is going to be\\na float. Now on line 8, we are trying to concatenate\\nor combine a string with a float, and python doesn't\\nknow how to execute this code. To solve this problem,\\nwe need to convert this float\\nto a string. So, here we use the built in\\nstir function. Let's run the program and see what\\nhappens\\nSo, 170 in pounds\\n\\nand here's my weight in kilograms. Now let's try\\nentering a weight in kilograms\\nSo, run it one more time, let's say 76\\nkilos, here we get a familiar error\\nCan only concatenate string to string, not float. So\\nthis error occurred on line 5, where we tried to\\nconcatenate\\na string to a float. So once again, we need to\\nconvert this to a string object. Now, let's run the\\nprogram one more time, 76 kilos\\nis equal to 168 pounds\\nHey guys, I just wanted to let you know that I have\\nan online coding school at\\ncodewithmosh.com, where you can find plenty of\\ncourses on web and mobile development\\nIn fact, I have a comprehensive python course that\\nteaches you everything about python\\nfrom the basics to more advanced concepts. So after\\nyou watch this tutorial\\nif you want to learn more, you may want to look at my\\npython course, it comes with a 30 day\\nmoney back guarantee, and a certificate of completion\\nyou can add to your resume\\nIn case you're interested, the link is below this\\n\\nvideo\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about\\nwhile loops in python. We use while loops to repeat a\\nblock of\\ncode multiple times. For example, let's say you want\\nto print the numbers 1 to 5\\nA poor way of doing this is writing code like this,\\nprint\\n1, then print 2, print 3, print 4, and\\nprint 5. Now, why is this a bad approach? Well, what\\nif you\\nwanted to print the numbers 1 to 1 million. We don't\\nwant to write 1 million\\nlines of code, each line printing a number. This is\\nwhere you use while\\nloops. So, we start off by declaring a variable, like\\ni\\nand set it to our initial number, let's say 1. Then\\nwe type\\nwhile, and here we type a condition. So once again we\\ncan use our comparison\\noperators. Let's say i less than 5\\nLess than or equal to 5. As long as this condition is\\ntrue\\nthen the code that we write inside of the while block\\nwill get executed\\n\\nSo here we type a colon and press enter, now we have\\na block of code. In this block we can print i\\nand then we need to increment i by 1. So we set i\\nto i plus 1. If we don't do this, i will always be 1\\nand this block of code will get executed indefinitely\\nIt will never terminate. Basically our program will\\ncontinue running until it\\nruns out of memory. So, in the first iteration\\ni is 1, it's less than 5, so python is going to\\nexecute this block\\nof code. It will print 1 on the terminal, and then i\\nbecomes 2\\nThen the control moves back over here. So python\\nevaluates\\nthis condition. 2 is less than or equal to 5, so the\\ncondition is true, and once again python is going to\\nexecute this block one more time\\nIn the second iteration, we're going to see 2 on the\\nterminal, and\\nthen i will become 3. So this will continue until\\nthis condition\\nis no longer true. Let me show you. So, let's run\\nthis program\\nnow we see the numbers 1 to 5. So this is the\\n\\nbeauty of while loops. I can easily change 5\\nto 1000, and by the way I'm separating these 3\\ndigits using an underscore, this makes my number more\\nreadable. We don't have to add\\nthis, but it just makes our code more readable. So,\\nlet's run the program\\nnow we see the numbers 1 to 1000. It's much\\neasier than 1000 lines of code each printing a\\nnumber. Okay?\\nNow let me show you something really cool. So I'm\\ngoing to change this\\nto 10, now, instead of\\nprinting i, I want to print an expression. So I'm\\ngoing to multiply i\\nby a string. An asterisk. Now\\nyou might be confused here, because earlier I told\\nyou that in python we cannot\\nconcatenate a number to a string. But here I'm using\\nthe\\nmultiplication operator. Well, this is different. We\\ncan multiply a number\\nby a string, and this will repeat that string based\\non the value\\nof that number. So if i is 1, we're going to see 1\\n\\nasterisk, if i is 5, we're going to see 5 asterisks.\\nLet me show you\\nSo, when we run this program, we see\\nthis triangle shape, because in the first iteration,\\ni is 1\\nso we see 1 asterisk, in every iteration, i is\\nincremented by 1, so we see 1 extra asterisk, and\\nfinally\\nin the last iteration, i is 10, and we see 10\\nasterisks\\non the terminal\\nSo you have learned\\nabout three types of data in python. We have numbers,\\nwhich can be\\nintegers or floats, we have booleans, and strings\\nThese are what we refer to as primitive or basic\\ntypes in\\npython. Now in python we have a bunch of complex\\ntypes as well\\nThese complex types are very useful in building real\\napplications\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about lists. We\\nuse lists whenever\\nwe want to represent a list of objects, like a list\\nof numbers, or a list of\\n\\nnames. Let me show you. So, I'm going to declare a\\nvariable\\ncalled names, and set it to a list of names. So here\\nwe add\\nsquare brackets to represent a list, and now we can\\nadd one or more\\nobjects inside this list. In this list we add a bunch\\nof names\\nLike John, Bob, Mosh\\nSam, and Mary. So we separate these elements\\nthese items using a comma. Now, let's print\\nour list, so print names, take a look\\nit comes out exactly like how we wrote it. Now we can\\nalso get individual elements in this list. For\\nexample, if you want to get\\nthe first element in this list, here we type a pair\\nof square brackets\\nand inside the square brackets, we type an index\\nThe index of the first element in this list is 0, so\\nnow, when we run\\nthis program, we're going to see John on the\\nterminal. There you go\\nNow, in python we can also use a negative index\\nThis is a feature that I personally have not seen in\\nother programming languages\\n\\nSo, if 0 represents the first element in this list\\nwhat do you think negative 1 represents?\\nIt represents the last element in this list. Let's\\nverify it\\nSo, let's run the program, and here's Mary. What\\nabout\\nnegative 2? Well, that represents\\nthe second element from the end of the list\\nSo, let's run the program, and here's Sam. Now we can\\nalso\\nchange an object at a given index. For example, let's\\nsay here we made a\\nmistake, and this John should not be spelled with an\\nh\\nSo, we need to reset it. We type names of 0\\nnow we treat this like a regular variable, so we set\\nit to a new value\\nWe set it to John without an h. Now let's\\nprint our list, and here's our updated list.\\nBeautiful\\nWe can also select a range of values. For example\\nlet's say we're only interested in the first three\\nnames\\nSo over here, we type square brackets, and here we\\n\\nneed to type\\ntwo indexes, a start index, and an end index\\nOur start index is a 0, because we want to start from\\nhere, and\\nour end index is going to be 0, 1, 2\\nplus 1, that's going to be 3. So, we add a\\ncolon, 3. So Python is going to return all the\\nelements\\nfrom the start index up to the end index, but\\nexcluding the\\nend index. So it's going to return the elements at\\nindex 0\\n1, and 2. Take a look\\nHere are the first three names. And by the way\\nthis expression does not modify our original list\\nit returns a new list. So, right after this print\\nstatement\\nif we print our original list\\nyou can see that it's not changed. So, this is how we\\nuse\\nlists in Python\\nEarlier I told you that strings in Python are\\nobjects. Objects in\\nprogramming are kind of like objects in the real\\n\\nworld. Like your mobile phone, your bicycle\\nthe remote control of your tv and so on. They have\\ncertain capabilities\\nSo if you type a string here, and then press dot\\nwe can see all the functions or methods available in\\na string object\\nin Python. Now, lists are also objects, so they have\\na bunch\\nof methods for adding items or removing them and so\\non. Let me show you\\nSo I'm going to declare a list of numbers, let's say\\n1, 2\\n3, 4, and 5. Now, to add a new element at the end\\nof this list, we can use the append method. So we\\ntype numbers\\ndot append, and here we type 6\\nNow, let's print our list\\nso here's our updated list. Beautiful. Now what if\\nyou want to\\ninsert a number somewhere in the middle or at the\\nbeginning. For that\\nuse the insert method. So, we're going to call\\nthe insert method, now on the top, go to the view\\nmenu\\nand look at parameter info. Look at the\\n\\nshortcut. On a Mac computer, it's command and p\\nOn Windows, it's probably control and p. If we use\\nthis shortcut\\nwe can see the values that this method expects\\nSo, the first value that this method expects is an\\nindex value\\nand the type of this value is an integer. So if I\\nwant to insert a value\\nat the beginning of this list, I should pass 0 as the\\nindex of the\\nfirst element, right? So let's pass 0. Now\\nthe second value is highlighted. So the second value\\nis an object\\nand the type of this is t. That basically means this\\ncan be\\nany type. We can pass a number, we can pass a\\nboolean, we can pass a string\\nwe can pass a list, or any type of objects in Python.\\nSo\\nI'm going to pass negative 1, now let's run our\\nprogram\\nyou can see negative 1 appeared at the beginning of\\nour list\\nWe also have a method for removing items. So, let's\\ncall\\n\\nremove 3. Let's run the program\\n3 is gone, we only have 1, 2, 4, and 5\\nNow if you want to remove all the items in the list,\\nwe call the clear method\\nSo clear, this method doesn't expect any values\\nSo let's run our program, our list is empty\\nNow sometimes you want to know if a given item exists\\nin our list or not. To do that\\nwe use the in operator. So, let's remove this line\\ninstead of printing our numbers list, I'm going to\\nprint an expression\\n1 in numbers\\nSo here we're using the in operator, we're checking\\nto see if 1 is\\nin the numbers list. So this is a boolean expression,\\nit returns a boolean\\nvalue. Take a look. So, we get true\\nObviously if you search for a value that doesn't\\nexist in this list\\nlike 10, we get false. Now finally\\nthere are times you want to know how many items you\\nhave in a list. To do that\\nyou can use the built in len function. So, let's\\nprint\\n\\nlen of numbers. So len\\nis a built in function, just like the print function,\\nthat is why it's highlighted\\nas purple. It returns the number of elements in a\\nlist. Take a look\\nSo we have 5 elements in this list\\nWhen writing Python programs, there are times\\nyou want to iterate over a list, and access each item\\nindividually\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to declare a list of\\nnumbers\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, now if we print this list\\nit comes out exactly like how we wrote it. Using the\\nsquare bracket notation. But what if we wanted to\\nprint each item on a separate line?\\nThat is where we use the for loop. Let me show you.\\nSo\\nwe're not going to print the entire list, instead\\nwe're going to type 4\\nnow we declare a variable which is called a loop\\nvariable\\nLet's call it item. Then we type in\\nnumbers, next we add a colon to start a block of code\\nSo this is what we call a for loop. With this for\\nloop\\n\\nwe can iterate over all the items in this list. In\\neach iteration\\nthis item variable is going to hold one value. So in\\nthe\\nfirst iteration, item is going to be equal to 1, and\\nthe second iteration is going to be\\nequal to 2, and so on. So, now if we print item\\nand run our program, we see each item on a new line\\nSo this is how you use a for loop. Now we could also\\nachieve the same thing using a while loop, but our\\ncode would be a little bit longer\\nLet me show you. So, we would have to start by\\ndeclaring a\\nloop variable outside of our while loop, let's say i,\\nwe set it to\\n0, now we say while i is less than\\nhere we need to find out how many items we have in\\nthis list. So\\nwe use the len function, len of numbers\\nSo as long as i is less than the length of the list\\nprint, now we can use the square bracket notation to\\nget the\\nelement at this index. So, numbers\\nof i. Now, we need to increment\\n\\ni by 1, so i equals i plus 1\\nLet's run the program and see what we get\\nSo we get the numbers 1 to 5, these are coming out\\nfrom our for loop\\nand then we get the numbers 1 to 5 one more time,\\nthese are coming out from\\nour while loop. Now if you compare these two\\napproaches, you can definitely see\\nthat the implementation using the for loop is shorter\\nand easier to understand\\nWe don't have to use the square bracket notation, we\\ndon't have to call\\nthe len function, we don't have to declare a\\nvariable, a loop variable\\nand then increment it explicitly, so with the for\\nloop\\nin each iteration, the item variable will\\nautomatically hold one value\\nin this list\\nIn this\\ntutorial, we're going to talk about the range\\nfunction in Python. We use the range\\nfunction to generate a sequence of numbers. Let me\\nshow you. So\\ntype range, this is a built in function, just like\\n\\nthe print and\\ninput functions, here we can pass a value like 5, and\\nthis will return\\na range object. A range object is an object that can\\nstore a sequence of numbers. Let me show you. So\\nlet's call that numbers, so this is a range object,\\nin this\\nobject we're going to have the numbers 0 to 5, but\\nexcluding 5\\nNow, if we print numbers\\nwe're going to see this message, range\\nof 0 to 5, not the actual numbers, because this is\\nthe default representation\\nof a range object. To see the actual numbers, we need\\nto iterate over\\nthis range object using a for loop. In the last video\\nyou learned\\nhow to iterate over a list using a for loop, but we\\ncan also iterate over a\\nrange object using a for loop. Basically we can use\\nthe for loop with\\nany object that represents a sequence of objects. So\\ninstead of printing numbers, we're going to use a for\\nloop\\nfor number, in numbers\\n\\ncolon, we're going to print number\\nTake a look. Now we see the numbers, 0\\nto 4. So, range of 5\\ngenerates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to\\nthe number\\nwe specify here. Now if we supply two values\\nthe first value is going to be considered the\\nstarting value, and\\nthe second value is going to be considered the ending\\nvalue and it's going to be excluded\\nSo range of 5 to 10 is going to generate the numbers\\n5 to\\n9. Take a look. There you go\\nNow we can also supply a third value, and that will\\nbe used as a step\\nSo let's say, instead of having a sequence of numbers\\nlike 5, 6\\n7, 8, 9, we want to jump two numbers at a time. So 5\\n7, 9 and so on. So here we pass 2 as the step\\nTake a look. So we get these odd numbers\\n5, 7, and 9. So this is the range\\nfunction in Python. Like quite often, you see the\\nrange function used as\\n\\npart of a for loop, because we don't really need to\\nstore the result in a separate\\nvariable, we can call the range function right here,\\nwhere we are\\nusing the numbers variable. So we can type range of 5\\nand this will return a range object holding the\\nnumbers 0 to 4\\nTake a look. There you go. So, we don't really need\\nto store the result in a separate variable like\\nnumbers\\nThere you go\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about tuples in\\nPython. Tuples are\\nkind of like lists, we use them to store a sequence\\nof objects, but\\ntuples are immutable, which means we cannot change\\nthem once we create them\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to start by defining a\\nlist of numbers\\n1, 2, 3, now we use square brackets to define a list\\nand parenthesis to define a tuple. So now, this\\nnumbers variable is storing a tuple. If we try\\nto reassign, let's say the first element, we're going\\nto get an error\\nTuple object does not support item assignment\\n\\nSo this is what I meant by tuples are immutable,\\nthey're\\nunchangeable. Also, if we type\\nnumbers dot, you don't see any methods like append\\ninsert, remove, and so on. We only have count and\\nindex\\nCount returns the number of occurrences of an\\nelement, for example\\nif we have, let's say, two 3's in this tuple\\nand call count of 3, this will return 2\\nThe other method we have here is index, and this\\nreturns\\nthe index of the first occurrence of the given\\nelement\\nNow, these other methods you see here that start with\\nan underscore, they're\\ncalled magic methods. It's an advanced topic, and\\nI've covered it in detail\\nin my complete Python programming course. If you're\\ninterested, the link is\\ndown below this video. So, tuples are immutable, we\\ncannot\\nchange them once we create them. Now practically\\nspeaking, most of the time\\nyou would be using lists, but there are times that\\n\\nonce you create a list of objects\\nyou want to make sure that somewhere in your program,\\nyou or someone else is not going to\\naccidentally modify that list. If that's the case,\\nthen you should use\\na tuple\\nIn case you're interested, the link is below this\\nvideo\\n\"]\n",

If you want to learn Python\\nprogramming for data science, machine learning, or\\nweb development, this Python\\ntutorial is the perfect place to learn Python. You\\ndon't need any prior knowledge in Python\\nor programming in general, I'm going to teach you\\neverything from scratch\\nI'm Mosh Hamadani, and I've taught millions of people\\nhow to code through this channel\\nIf you're new here, make sure to subscribe as I\\nupload new videos every week. Now\\nlet's jump in and get started. Alright, before we get\\nstarted, let me give you some\\nideas about what you can do with Python. That's a\\nvery common question\\nPython is a multipurpose programming language, so you\\ncan use it for a variety of different tasks\\nYou can use Python for machine learning and AI. In\\nfact, Python is the number\\none language for machine learning and data science\\nprojects. Python is also very\\npopular in web development. Using Python and a\\nframework called Django\\nyou can build amazing websites. Here are five\\nwebsites powered with Python and Django\\n\\nYouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, and Pinterest\\nYou can also use Python in automation. With Python\\nyou can save your time\\nand increase your productivity by automating\\nrepetitive tasks\\nSo, why are you learning Python? Are you learning it\\nfor automation, for data science\\nor web development? Let me know in the comments\\nsection below\\nAlright, the first thing I want you to do is to head\\nover to python.org to download\\nthe latest version of Python. So you go to downloads\\nand select\\nthe latest version of Python\\nHere in your downloads folder, you should see this\\npackage, simply\\ndouble click it, you're going to see this Python\\ninstaller\\nif you're on Windows, you will see this check box\\nover here, add Python to\\npath. Make sure to check it, it's really important,\\notherwise you're not\\ngoing to be able to follow this tutorial. Simply\\nclick on continue\\nagain, one more time, agree with the terms\\n\\nand install the latest version of Python\\nNow here you need to enter the username and password\\nof your computer, so\\nlet's do that real quick\\nNext you need to install a code editor. We use a code\\neditor to\\nwrite our code and execute it. The most popular code\\neditor for Python is\\nPyCharm. You can get it from jetbrains.com\\nSo on this page, click on\\ndownload, you should see two different editions, one\\nis\\nthe professional edition which is commercial, and we\\nalso have this community\\nedition which is free and open source. So we're going\\nto download the community\\nedition\\nNow in your downloads folder, you should have this\\npackage, let's double click it\\nif you're on Windows, you're going to see an\\ninstallation\\nwizard, so simply click on the next button until you\\ninstall PyCharm\\nIf you're on a Mac, you need to drag this PyCharm and\\ndrop it onto\\n\\nthe applications folder\\nNow, let's open it, the first time you open\\nPyCharm, you have to configure a few settings. We\\ndon't want to spend time on this\\nso over here, you're going to click on skip remaining\\nand set\\ndefaults. Now let's create a new project\\nover here we can specify the location and the name of\\nour\\npython project. So, let's append hello world\\nto this path. This is where our python project is\\ngoing to be saved\\nSo, let's click on create\\nin this window you can see the content of our\\nproject, so\\nhere's our hello world project, currently we have\\nonly one folder inside this project\\nthat is vn, which is short for virtual environment,\\nwe'll talk about virtual\\nenvironments in the future. So currently we don't\\nhave any python files inside\\nthis project. A real application can consist of tens\\nor hundreds\\nor even thousands of python files. So, let's right\\nclick on the project\\n\\nname, and go to new python file\\nwe're going to call this file app\\nNow we can collapse this project window by clicking\\non this icon. So now we have\\nmore space, let's write our first python code. We're\\ngoing to write print\\nall in lower case, then add parenthesis, then add\\nquotes, either single quotes or double quotes\\nAnd inside these quotes we're going to write hello\\nworld. So this is what\\nwe call a string. A string means a string or sequence\\nof\\ncharacters. In simple words, that means textual data.\\nSo in\\npython and in many other programming languages,\\nwhenever we're dealing with\\ntextual data, we should always surround our text with\\nquotes\\nIn python we can use single or double quotes\\nNow this print you see here is a function built into\\npython, and we can\\nuse it to print a message on our application window.\\nSo let me show you\\nhow to run this code. On the top, we go to the run\\nmenu\\n\\nand then select run. Note that there is a shortcut\\nassociated\\nwith this command, I always use shortcuts because\\nthey increase my productivity\\nSo, let's click on this, now select app\\nand over here, you can see this little window, this\\nis what we call\\nthe terminal window, and it shows the output of our\\nprogram\\nSo here's the hello world message printed in the\\nterminal window. Now as you learn\\nmore python, you will learn how to build applications\\nthat have a graphical user\\ninterface. That's an advanced topic, so for now,\\nlet's not worry about it\\nAlright, now let's talk about variables\\nWe use variables to temporarily store data in a\\ncomputer's memory\\nFor example, we can store the price of a product, or\\nsomeone's name\\ntheir email, their age, and so on. Let me show you.\\nSo\\nto declare a variable, we start by typing a name for\\nthat variable\\nLet's say age, then we add an equal sign\\nand then we type a value, let's say 20. So with this\\n\\nwe're storing the\\nnumber 20 somewhere in our computer's memory, and\\nwe're attaching this\\nage as a label for that memory location. So now we\\ncan read the\\nvalue at this memory location, and print it on the\\nterminal. So\\ninstead of printing hello world, we want to print the\\nvalue of the age\\nvariable. So I'm going to delete what we have inside\\nparenthesis\\nand type age. Note that I'm not adding\\nquotes, because if I run this program, we'll see the\\ntext age\\non the terminal. We don't want that, we want the\\nvalue of the age variable\\nSo, let's remove the quotes, and\\nprint the value of the age variable. Now here on the\\ntoolbar, you can click\\non this play icon to run your program, or you can use\\nthe shortcut that I\\nshowed you in the last video. So, the shortcut is\\nover here\\nOn a Mac, that's control shift and r. So\\nthere you go, now you can see the value of the age\\n\\nvariable. Now we can also change the value of a\\nvariable\\nFor example, on line 2, we can set age to\\n30, now when we run our program, we see 30\\nSo as you can see, our program gets executed from top\\nto bottom\\nSo this is how we can declare and use a variable. Now\\nlet's look at\\na few more examples. So, I'm going to declare another\\nvariable\\ncalled price, and set it to 19.95\\nSo in Python we can use numbers with a decimal point,\\nor\\nwhole numbers. We can also declare a variable and\\nassign it a string value. So, let's say first\\nunderline name. So if you want to use multiple words\\nin the name\\nof a variable, we should separate them using an\\nunderscore. This makes\\nour code more readable. See what would happen if I\\ndidn't use this\\nunderline. This is not easily readable. So, we always\\nseparate multiple words by an underscore. Now we set\\nthis to a string. So we can use single quotes or\\ndouble quotes\\n\\nLet's say mosh. We also have a special type of value\\ncalled\\na boolean value which can be true or false. That is\\nlike\\nyes or no in English. Let me show you. So, I'm going\\nto\\ndeclare another variable called is online, and\\nset it to true. We can also set it to false\\nWhat we have here is called a boolean value. Now note\\nthat\\nPython is a case sensitive language, so it's\\nsensitive to lower case and\\nupper case letters. In this case, if I use a lower\\ncase f\\nyou can see an error over here, because this is not\\nrecognized\\nin Python. So false with a capital f is a special\\nkeyword in Python that represents the boolean false\\nvalue\\nSo this is how we can declare and use variables in\\nPython\\nAlright, now here's a little exercise for you.\\nImagine you want to write a program\\nfor a hospital. So we're going to check in a patient\\nnamed John Smith\\n\\nhe's 20 years old, and he's a new patient. I want you\\nto declare a few\\nvariables to store these values. Use the comment box\\nbelow to share\\nyour code with others\\nIn this\\ntutorial, I'm going to show you how to receive input\\nfrom the user. So in Python\\nwe have another built in function called input, we\\nuse this to\\nread a value from the terminal window. Let me show\\nyou. So, we add\\nparenthesis, then we type a string, here we can type\\na message\\nlike what is your name? We add a question mark\\nfollowed by a space. You will see why we need this\\nspace in a second. So\\nlet's run this program, we get this message, now we\\nhave\\nto enter a value. So, we click over here, now you can\\nsee that the\\ncaret is separated from the question mark, this is\\nbecause of the white space\\nthat we added over here. So now, we have to type a\\nvalue, let's say\\nJohn, when we press enter, this function\\n\\nwill return the value that we entered in the terminal\\nwindow. So we can\\nget that value and store it in a variable. So, let's\\ndeclare a variable\\ncalled name, and set it to the return value of the\\ninput function. Now we can print a greeting message\\nfor this user\\nSo, we use the print function, we say\\nhello, we add a space, now after the string\\nwe want to add the value of the name variable. So, we\\nuse a\\nplus sign, and then type name. What we are doing here\\nis called\\nstring concatenation. So we're combining this string\\nwith\\nanother string. Now let's run our program and see\\nwhat happens\\nSo, what is your name? Mosh, now\\nwe get this message. Hello Mosh. So this is how we\\ncan use the input function\\nin Python\\nYou'll learn about the three\\ntypes of data in Python. We have numbers, strings\\nand booleans. Now there are times you want to convert\\n\\nthe value of a\\nvariable from one type to another. Let me show you.\\nSo, we're going to\\nuse our input function to read the user's birth year\\nSo, enter your birth year\\nNow this input function is going to return a value\\nso we can store it in a variable called birth\\nunderline\\nyear. Okay, now let's write code to calculate\\nthe age of this user. So, we write an expression like\\nthis. Currently\\nwe are in the year 2020, so 2020 minus\\nbirth year, this expression or piece of code is going\\nto produce\\na value, so once again we can store that value in a\\nvariable. Let's call\\nthat variable age. Now let's print age\\non the terminal. Let's run our program and see what\\nhappens\\nSo, my birth year is 1982\\nenter, oops, our program crashed. So whenever you see\\nthis red\\nmessage, that indicates an error, so this error\\noccurred in this\\n\\nfile, that is our app.py on line 2\\nRight below that you can see the piece of code that\\ngenerated\\nthis error. So that is this expression, 2020 minus\\nbirth year\\nNow below that you can see the type of error, so here\\nwe have\\nunsupported types or subtraction\\nWe have int and str. What are these?\\nWell this int is short for integer and that\\nrepresents a whole number\\nin programming. So, 2020 is\\nan example of an integer. Now birth year is an\\nexample of a\\nstring, because whenever we call the input function,\\nthis function\\nwill return a value as a string, even if we enter a\\nnumber\\nIn other words, when I entered 1982, this input\\nfunction\\nreturned a string with these characters, 1982\\nSo this string is different from the number 1982\\nThey're completely different types. So in this case,\\nlet me delete\\nthese lines, the reason we got this error is that we\\n\\ntried to\\nsubtract a string from an integer. So our code looks\\nlike this\\n1982. Now Python doesn't know\\nhow to subtract a string from an integer. So, to\\nsolve this problem\\nwe need to convert this string to an integer. Now in\\nPython\\nwe have a bunch of built in functions for converting\\nthe types of our variables\\nso we have this int function, we can\\npass our birth year to it, and this will return the\\nnumeric\\nrepresentation of the birth year. So, to solve this\\nproblem\\nwe need to replace the string\\nwith an int function. So let's see what's going on\\nhere\\nOn the first line, we call the input function, this\\nreturns a string\\non the second line, we pass the string to our int\\nfunction\\nthe int function will return the numeric\\nrepresentation of the birth year\\nThen, we subtract it from 2020, we get the age\\n\\nand store it in the age variable. Now let's run our\\nprogram\\nso, 1982, and there you go\\nI'm 38 years old. So this is how the int function\\nworks\\nNow we also have another built in function called\\nfloat\\nthat is for converting a value to a floating point\\nnumber. A floating\\npoint number in Python and other programming\\nlanguages is a number\\nwith a decimal point. So, 10 is an integer\\nand 10.1 is a float. So, we have int\\nwe have float, and we also have bool, for converting\\na value to a boolean, and finally we have stir\\nfor converting a value to a string. So these are the\\nbuilt in functions\\nfor converting the type of our variables. Now here's\\na little\\nexercise for you. I want you to write a basic\\ncalculator program\\nSo here we have to enter two numbers, we can type a\\nwhole number or a number\\nwith a decimal point, and then our program will print\\nthe sum of these two numbers. So pause the video,\\n\\nspend two minutes on this\\nexercise, and then see my solution\\nAlright, first we're going to call our input function\\nto read\\nthe first number, we get the result and store it in a\\nvariable called\\nfirst. Now, let's declare another variable\\ncalled second, and read the second number\\nNow, we calculate the sum\\nso that is first plus second, now let's see what\\nhappens\\nwhen we print sum on the terminal. So I enter\\n10 and 20, but instead of 30 we get 10\\n20, this is because we're combining or concatenating\\ntwo strings\\nSo, as I told you before, the input\\nfunction returns a string, so this line\\nwill be equivalent to first equals 10. You're dealing\\nwith a string, not an integer. Similarly\\nsecond is going to be 20 as a string, so when we\\ncombine\\ntwo strings, 10 plus 20 will get\\n10 20, because we're dealing with textual data. Okay?\\n\\nSo to solve this problem, we need to convert the\\nvalues we read to their numeric representation. So,\\nover here\\nwe're going to pass first to our int function\\nand here as well, now let's run our program\\nso we enter 10 and 20, we get 30\\nWhat if we enter a floating point number, so 10.1\\nand 20. You got an error\\nSo, to solve this problem, we need to treat\\nboth these values as floats, so instead of the int\\nfunction\\nwe're going to use the float function, now\\nlet's run our program one more time, we enter a whole\\nnumber\\nand a floating point number. So the result is\\ncorrect, now\\nlet's add a label over here, so sum\\nis plus sum. Let's run our program\\none more time, 10 and 20, once again, we got an error\\nThe error is saying that Python can only concatenate\\nstrings, not floats to strings. So on line 4\\nwe have a string, we're concatenating this\\n\\nwith a float, because the result of this expression\\nis a floating point number\\nWe're adding two floats, so the result is a float as\\nwell\\nSo Python doesn't know how to evaluate code like this\\nIt doesn't know how to concatenate a float\\nto a string. To solve this problem\\nwe need to convert sum to a string. So this is where\\nwe use the stir function. Now, let's run the program\\nagain, so 10 plus 20.1 and\\nhere's the result. And one last thing, in this\\nexample\\nI'm calling the float function at the time we want to\\ncalculate the sum of these two\\nnumbers, but this is not a requirement. We can call\\nthe float function\\nover here. So this input function returns a\\nstring, we can pass that string to our float\\nfunction. Take a look\\nSo float, parenthesis, like this. So\\nthe value that we're passing to the float function is\\nthe value that is returned\\nfrom the input function. Similarly\\n\\nwe call the float function over here, now\\nwe can change this expression to first plus second\\nThat is another way to write this piece of code. So\\ntype\\nconversion is important in Python and other\\nprogramming languages, there are times\\nyou need to convert the type of variable to a\\ndifferent type\\nIn this tutorial, I'm going to show you a bunch of\\ncool things you can do with\\nstrings in Python. So let's start by declaring a\\nvariable called\\ncourse, and set it to Python for beginners\\nNow this string that we have over here is technically\\nan\\nobject. An object in Python is like an object in the\\nreal world\\nAs a metaphor, think of the remote control of your\\ntv. This remote control\\nis an object, and it has a bunch of capabilities. It\\nhas a bunch of buttons for\\nturning your tv on, turning it off, changing the\\nvolume and so on\\nNow in this program, this course variable is storing\\na string object\\nThis string object has a bunch of capabilities. So if\\n\\nyou type\\ncourse dot, you can see all the capabilities\\navailable\\nin a string object. These are basically functions\\nthat you can call. Just like\\nthe print or input functions. The difference is that\\nthe print and input\\nfunctions are general purpose functions. They don't\\nbelong to a particular object\\nBut the functions you see over here are specific to\\nstrings\\nNow more accurately, we refer to these as methods. So\\nwhen\\na function is part of an object, we refer to that\\nfunction as a method\\nSo, let's look at a few examples. Here we have a\\nfunction or\\na method called upper, and we use that to convert a\\nstring to uppercase\\nSo if we print course dot upper\\nand run this program, you can see our course in\\nuppercase\\nPretty useful. Now what you need to understand here,\\nis that this upper method\\ndoes not change our original string, it will return a\\nnew string\\n\\nSo right after this, if we print course\\nyou can see that our course variable is not affected\\nSo the upper method returns a new string\\nSimilarly we have another method called lower, for\\nconverting\\na string to lower case. We have a method called find,\\nto see if our\\nstring contains a character or a sequence of\\ncharacters. For example\\nhere we can pass y, and this will return\\nthe index of the first occurrence of y in our string.\\nSo\\nin Python, the index of the first character in our\\nstring\\nis 0. So here we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. So\\nwhen we run this\\nprogram, you're going to see 1 on the terminal,\\nbecause the index of\\ny is 1. Take a look. First I'm going to delete this\\nline\\nwe don't need it anymore, also, let's delete this\\nline\\nlet's run the program, there you go. Now as\\nI told you before, Python is sensitive to lower case\\nand uppercase letters\\n\\nso if I pass an uppercase y here\\nthis find method returns negative 1, because we\\ndon't have an uppercase y in this string. We can also\\npass a sequence\\nof characters, for example 4, so this will return the\\nindex of the word 4. Take a look. So it's\\n7. Now there are times you want to replace something\\nin a string with\\nsomething else. To do that we use the replace method\\nReplace. So we can replace 4 with\\na string containing the number 4. Take a look\\nSo Python for beginners. Obviously\\nif you look for a character or a sequence of\\ncharacters that don't exist in our string\\nnothing is going to happen. For example, if you try\\nto replace x with\\n4, obviously we don't have x here, so nothing is\\ngoing to\\nhappen. Also, just like the upper method, the replace\\nmethod is not going to modify our original string, so\\nit's going to return\\na new string. This is because strings in Python and\\nmany other\\nprogramming languages are immutable. We cannot change\\n\\nthem once we create them\\nWhenever we want to change a string, we'll end up\\nwith a new string object in\\nmemory. Now one last thing I want to cover in this\\ntutorial. There are times you want to\\nsee if your string contains a character or a sequence\\nof characters\\nOne way to do that is using the find method that we\\ntalked about\\nso let's see if our string contains Python\\nNow when we run this program, that is the index\\nof the first occurrence of the word Python in our\\nstring. Now in\\nPython we can also use the in operator. So we can\\nwrite an expression\\nlike this. We type a string, Python\\nthen we type in, this is a special keyword in Python\\nthis is what we call the in operator, so after that\\nwe type the name of our variable. So with this\\nexpression\\nwe're checking to see if we have Python in course\\nAs you can see, Python code is very readable, it's\\nlike plain English. So\\nwhen we run this program, instead of seeing the index\\nof the first\\n\\noccurrence of Python, we see a boolean value. This is\\nmore desirable in\\na lot of cases. Next we're going to look at\\narithmetic operations\\nIn this tutorial, I'm going to show you the\\narithmetic operators that we have in Python\\nThese are the same arithmetic operators that we have\\nin math. For example, we can\\nadd numbers, we can subtract them, multiply them and\\nso on. So let's\\nprint 10 plus 3, when we run this program\\nwe get 13. So this is the addition operator\\nWe also have subtraction, we have multiplication, and\\ndivision. Now technically we have two different types\\nof division operators\\nWe have a division with one slash and another with\\ntwo slashes\\nLet's look at the differences. If you use a single\\nslash\\nwe get a floating point number, that is a number with\\na decimal point\\nbut if you use double slashes, we get an integer\\na whole number. We also have the modulus operator\\nthat is indicated by a percent sign, and this returns\\nthe\\n\\nremainder of the division of 10 by 3. So, that is\\n1. And finally we have the exponent operator that is\\nindicated\\nby 2 asterisks. So this is 10 to the power of 3\\nSo when we run this, we get 1000. Now\\nfor all these operators that you saw, we have an\\naugmented assignment\\noperator. Let me explain what it means. So, let's say\\nwe have a variable\\ncalled x, and we set it to 10. Now we want to\\nincrement the value of x by 3. So we have to write\\ncode like this\\nx equals x plus 3. When Python executes\\nthis code, it's going to evaluate this expression or\\nthis piece of code\\nthe result of this expression is 10 plus 3 which is\\n13. Then it will\\nstore 13 in the x. Now there is another way\\nto achieve the same result using less code. We can\\ntype x\\nplus equal 3. What we have on line 3 is\\nexactly identical to what we have on line 2. So what\\nwe have here is called\\nthe augmented assignment operator. So we have this\\n\\nassignment\\noperator, but we have augmented or enhanced it\\nNow here we can also use subtraction to decrease the\\nvalue\\nof x by 3, we can use multiplication and so on\\nSo these are the arithmetic operators in Python\\nAlright, let me ask you a question. I'm going to\\ndeclare a variable called x\\nand set it to 10 plus 3 times 2. What do you think\\nis the result of this expression? This is a basic\\nmath question that unfortunately\\na lot of people fail to answer. The answer is 16\\nHere's the reason. In math we have this concept\\ncalled operator\\nprecedence, and that determines the order in which\\nthese operators\\nare applied. So multiplication and division have a\\nhigher\\norder, so this part of the expression gets evaluated\\nfirst, so 2 times\\n3 is 6, and then the result is added to 10\\nThat is why the result of this expression is 16. Now\\nin Python\\noperator precedence is exactly like math, but we can\\nalways change it using\\n\\nparenthesis. For example, in this expression, if you\\nwant 10 plus 3\\nto be evaluated first, we can wrap it in parenthesis\\nSo, like this. Now when we execute this code\\nwe're going to see 26, because 10 plus 3 is 13\\nand that divided by 2 is 26. Let's verify this. So\\nprint x\\nand we get 26\\nSo you learned about the arithmetic operators in\\nPython. Now in\\nPython we have another set of operators called\\ncomparison operators\\nWe use these operators to compare values. Let me show\\nyou\\nSo, I'm going to declare a variable called x, and set\\nit to an expression like this\\n3 is greater than 2. So what we have here\\nthis piece of code, this expression is called a\\nboolean expression\\nbecause it produces a boolean value. So in this case,\\nbecause 3 is\\ngreater than 2, the result of this expression is the\\nboolean true\\nSo, if we print x\\n\\nwe get true on the terminal. So here's the greater\\nthan operator\\nWe also have greater than or equal to, we have\\nless than, we have less than or equal to, here's the\\nequality operator, which is indicated by two equal\\nsigns, do not\\nconfuse this with the assignment operator. So here\\nwe're comparing 3\\nand 2 for equality. So if we run our program\\nwe see false, because 3 does not equal to 2\\nSo here's the equality operator, we also have the not\\nequality\\noperator, that is indicated by an exclamation mark,\\nfollowed\\nby an equal sign. So, let's quickly recap. Here are\\nthe\\ncomparison operators we have in Python. Greater than,\\ngreater\\nthan or equal to, less than, less than or equal to,\\nequal\\nand not equal. These operators are extremely\\nimportant in\\nreal Python programs, because quite often we have to\\ncompare values\\nto evaluate certain conditions. You're going to see\\nthat soon\\n\\nIn Python\\nwe have another set of operators called logical\\noperators\\nWe use these operators to build complex rules and\\nconditions\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to declare a variable\\ncalled price, and set it to\\n25. Now let's print a boolean expression like this\\nPrice is greater than 10. Now let's\\nsay we want to check to see if the price is between\\n10 and 30\\nThis is where we use the logical and operator. So we\\ntype\\nand, and right after that we type another boolean\\nexpression\\nSo price less than 30. So with this and operator\\nif both these boolean expressions return true, the\\nresult\\nof this entire expression will be true. Take a look.\\nSo\\nin this case we get true, because the price is\\nbetween\\n10 and 30 dollars. We also have the or operator\\nWith the or operator, if at least one of these\\nboolean\\n\\nexpressions returns true, then the result of this\\nentire expression will be\\ntrue. To demonstrate this, I'm going to change price\\nto 5. Let's see how Python is going to execute this\\ncode. So first it's\\ngoing to look at this boolean expression. Is price\\ngreater than 10?\\nNo it's not, so it will keep going. Then it will look\\nat the second\\nboolean expression. Is price less than 30? It sure is\\nso the result of this entire expression will be true.\\nTake a look\\nThere you go. We also have the not operator\\nwhich basically inverses any values that you give it.\\nLet me show you. So\\nwe're going to have one boolean expression\\nprice greater than 10. The result of this expression\\nis false\\nNow if you apply the not operator, this will inverse\\nfalse to true. So, when we run the program we get\\ntrue\\nSo let's quickly recap. In Python we have 3\\nlogical operators. We have logical and, which returns\\ntrue if both\\n\\nexpressions return true, we have logical or, which\\nreturns\\ntrue if at least one expression returns true, and we\\nhave\\nnot, which inverses any value that we give it\\nIn this tutorial\\nwe're going to talk about if statements in Python. We\\nuse if statements\\nto make decisions in our programs. For example, we\\ncan declare a variable\\ncalled temperature, and depending on the value of\\nthis variable, we can\\nprint different messages on the terminal. Let me show\\nyou. So, here's our\\ntemperature variable, we set it to 35. Now let's say\\nif temperature is greater than 30, we want to print a\\nmessage saying\\nit's a hot day. So we type if, then we type a\\ncondition, and this is where we use our comparison\\noperators. So we type\\ntemperature greater than 30. Then\\nso we add a colon, and see what happens when I press\\nenter now\\nThe character is indented, and this represents a\\nblock\\n\\nof code. So the code that we write over here will be\\nexecuted\\nif this condition is true. Otherwise, it's not going\\nto be executed. Let me show you\\nSo, we're going to print\\nit's a hot day, and by the way, note that here I've\\nsurrounded\\nthe string with double quotes, because here we have a\\nsingle\\nquote as an apostrophe. So I couldn't declare a\\nstring like this\\nWith single quotes. If I type it's a hot day\\nlook, Python gets confused. Because it thinks this\\nsingle\\nquote represents the end of our string, so it doesn't\\nrecognize the subsequent\\ncharacters. So that's why we use double\\nquotes here, so we can have an apostrophe in our\\nstring\\nSo it's a hot day. Now if I press enter again\\nthe character is indented, so the code that we write\\nhere\\nwill be part of our if block, and it will get\\nexecuted if this condition\\nis true. So here we can print a second message\\n\\ndrink plenty of water. Now to terminate this block\\nwe press enter, and then press shift and tab\\nThe character is no longer indented, so the code that\\nwe write here\\nwill always get executed no matter what. Whether this\\ncondition is true\\nor not. Now in C based programming languages like C++\\nC sharp, Java, and JavaScript, we present a block of\\ncode using curly braces. So, you start a block\\nof code using a left brace, and then end it using a\\nright brace\\nIn Python we don't have curly braces. So we use\\nindentation to\\nrepresent a block of code. So, in this\\ncase, these two lines are indented, and that means\\nthey are\\npart of this block of code. Now, let's run the\\nprogram and see what\\nhappens. So we see these two messages because the\\ntemperature is\\ngreater than 30. Now, if I change the temperature\\nto 25, and run the program again, we don't see\\nanything. Now, after this block\\nlet's print done. Because this code is not indented\\n\\nit will always get executed. It's not part of our if\\nblock\\nSo, take a look. Here's the done message\\nNow, let's add a second condition. So if temperature\\nis not greater than 30, that means it's less than or\\nequal\\nto 30. So, I'm going to add a second condition\\nso if the temperature is between 20 and 30, I want to\\nprint it's a\\nnice day. So here we type elif\\nthat is short for else if, and here we type a second\\ncondition\\nSo temperature greater than 20\\nWe add a colon, press enter, now we have a new block\\nSo here we can print, it's a nice day\\nSo if this condition is true, that means the\\ntemperature is greater than 20 and less than\\nor equal to 30. Now what we have here is called a\\ncomment\\nthat is why it's grayed out. It's not real code, it's\\njust some note that we add to our\\nprogram. Python is not going to execute this. So\\nwhenever we type a\\n\\npound sign, what we have after is treated as a\\ncomment\\nSo, if this condition is true, then we're going to\\nsee\\nthis message on the terminal. Let's run our program\\nand verify this\\nThere you go, the temperature is 25, that's why we\\nsee this\\nmessage. Now we can have as many conditions as we\\nwant, there are no\\nlimitations, okay? So let's add another condition\\nElif, temperature is greater than 10\\nthen we're going to print, it's a bit cold\\nNow in this case, if this condition is true, that\\nmeans\\nthe temperature is greater than 10 and less than or\\nequal to 20\\nNow finally if the temperature is less than 10, let's\\nprint a message saying it's a cold day. So, here we\\ntype\\nelse, then we add a colon, and now we have a new\\nblock\\nSo, this code will get executed if none of the above\\nconditions are true. So, here we can print\\nit's cold. So this is how\\n\\nwe use if statements to make decisions in our\\nprograms\\nHere's a great exercise for you to practice what you\\nhave learned so far\\nI want you to write a weight converter program like\\nthis\\nSo this program is asking me my weight, I enter 170\\nNext it's asking me if the weight is in kilograms or\\npounds. So I can type k for kilograms or l for pounds\\nI can type a lower case l or an upper case l, it\\ndoesn't matter\\nSo let's go with a lower case l. Now it tells me\\nweight in kilogram is 76.5\\nSo go ahead and spend 5 minutes on this exercise, you\\ncan use the comment box below\\nto share your code with others, and then when you're\\ndone come back and see my solution\\nSo first we call our input function to ask the first\\nquestion\\nWeight. We get the result and store it in a variable\\ncalled\\nweight. Next we call the input function one more time\\nto\\nask the second question. Is this in kilogram or\\n\\npounds? We get the\\nresult and store it in a variable called unit, this\\nis where we're going to\\nuse an if statement. So, we want to check to see if\\nunit\\nequals k. Then\\nwe should convert the weight to pounds and print it\\non a terminal. However\\nwith this code, if I type a lower case k, this\\ncondition is not\\ngoing to be true. Because earlier I told you that\\npython is a case sensitive language\\nSo, we need to convert this string to upper case\\nEarlier we talked about string methods. So if you\\ntype dot\\nwe can see all the functions or methods available in\\na string object\\nSo we use the upper method, and this returns a new\\nstring\\nin upper case. Now, if this condition is true, first\\nwe need to convert the weight to pounds. So we\\ndeclare a new variable called\\nconvert it, get the weight, and divide it by\\n0.45. And then we can print this\\non a terminal. So, we say weight\\n\\nin pounds is, then we append convert it\\nNow, to terminate this block, we press shift and tab\\nelse colon, so if this condition is not\\ntrue, that means the weight was entered in pounds, so\\nwe need to convert it to\\nkilograms. Once again, we declare a variable, convert\\nit\\nand set it to weight times 0.45\\nAnd then we print weight in kilograms\\nand here we concatenate\\nthis string with converted. Alright, now we need to\\nterminate this block\\nso we press enter, then shift and tab, good\\nNow if we run this program, we're going to see an\\nerror, let me show you. So, let's run\\nit, here I'm going to enter 170, then I\\ntype a lower case l, okay, here's an error\\nCan't multiply sequence by non int of type float\\nSo this is where we got this error. When we try to\\nmultiply the weight by 0.45. So\\nthat is line 7 in our code. Now, the reason this is\\nhappening\\n\\nis because the weight variable is storing a string\\nobject\\nBecause earlier I told you, the input function always\\nreturns a string\\nSo here we need to convert the weight to a number\\nWe can either use the int or the float function.\\nLet's run\\nthe program one more time. So, 170\\nin pounds, here's a second error\\nCan only concatenate string, not float to string\\nAnd that error occurred over here\\nWhen we tried to print the weight in kilograms. So\\nlook at line 7. In this case, weight is an integer,\\nwe are\\nmultiplying an integer by a float, and the result of\\nthis operation is going to be\\na float. Now on line 8, we are trying to concatenate\\nor combine a string with a float, and python doesn't\\nknow how to execute this code. To solve this problem,\\nwe need to convert this float\\nto a string. So, here we use the built in\\nstir function. Let's run the program and see what\\nhappens\\nSo, 170 in pounds\\n\\nand here's my weight in kilograms. Now let's try\\nentering a weight in kilograms\\nSo, run it one more time, let's say 76\\nkilos, here we get a familiar error\\nCan only concatenate string to string, not float. So\\nthis error occurred on line 5, where we tried to\\nconcatenate\\na string to a float. So once again, we need to\\nconvert this to a string object. Now, let's run the\\nprogram one more time, 76 kilos\\nis equal to 168 pounds\\nHey guys, I just wanted to let you know that I have\\nan online coding school at\\ncodewithmosh.com, where you can find plenty of\\ncourses on web and mobile development\\nIn fact, I have a comprehensive python course that\\nteaches you everything about python\\nfrom the basics to more advanced concepts. So after\\nyou watch this tutorial\\nif you want to learn more, you may want to look at my\\npython course, it comes with a 30 day\\nmoney back guarantee, and a certificate of completion\\nyou can add to your resume\\nIn case you're interested, the link is below this\\n\\nvideo\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about\\nwhile loops in python. We use while loops to repeat a\\nblock of\\ncode multiple times. For example, let's say you want\\nto print the numbers 1 to 5\\nA poor way of doing this is writing code like this,\\nprint\\n1, then print 2, print 3, print 4, and\\nprint 5. Now, why is this a bad approach? Well, what\\nif you\\nwanted to print the numbers 1 to 1 million. We don't\\nwant to write 1 million\\nlines of code, each line printing a number. This is\\nwhere you use while\\nloops. So, we start off by declaring a variable, like\\ni\\nand set it to our initial number, let's say 1. Then\\nwe type\\nwhile, and here we type a condition. So once again we\\ncan use our comparison\\noperators. Let's say i less than 5\\nLess than or equal to 5. As long as this condition is\\ntrue\\nthen the code that we write inside of the while block\\nwill get executed\\n\\nSo here we type a colon and press enter, now we have\\na block of code. In this block we can print i\\nand then we need to increment i by 1. So we set i\\nto i plus 1. If we don't do this, i will always be 1\\nand this block of code will get executed indefinitely\\nIt will never terminate. Basically our program will\\ncontinue running until it\\nruns out of memory. So, in the first iteration\\ni is 1, it's less than 5, so python is going to\\nexecute this block\\nof code. It will print 1 on the terminal, and then i\\nbecomes 2\\nThen the control moves back over here. So python\\nevaluates\\nthis condition. 2 is less than or equal to 5, so the\\ncondition is true, and once again python is going to\\nexecute this block one more time\\nIn the second iteration, we're going to see 2 on the\\nterminal, and\\nthen i will become 3. So this will continue until\\nthis condition\\nis no longer true. Let me show you. So, let's run\\nthis program\\nnow we see the numbers 1 to 5. So this is the\\n\\nbeauty of while loops. I can easily change 5\\nto 1000, and by the way I'm separating these 3\\ndigits using an underscore, this makes my number more\\nreadable. We don't have to add\\nthis, but it just makes our code more readable. So,\\nlet's run the program\\nnow we see the numbers 1 to 1000. It's much\\neasier than 1000 lines of code each printing a\\nnumber. Okay?\\nNow let me show you something really cool. So I'm\\ngoing to change this\\nto 10, now, instead of\\nprinting i, I want to print an expression. So I'm\\ngoing to multiply i\\nby a string. An asterisk. Now\\nyou might be confused here, because earlier I told\\nyou that in python we cannot\\nconcatenate a number to a string. But here I'm using\\nthe\\nmultiplication operator. Well, this is different. We\\ncan multiply a number\\nby a string, and this will repeat that string based\\non the value\\nof that number. So if i is 1, we're going to see 1\\n\\nasterisk, if i is 5, we're going to see 5 asterisks.\\nLet me show you\\nSo, when we run this program, we see\\nthis triangle shape, because in the first iteration,\\ni is 1\\nso we see 1 asterisk, in every iteration, i is\\nincremented by 1, so we see 1 extra asterisk, and\\nfinally\\nin the last iteration, i is 10, and we see 10\\nasterisks\\non the terminal\\nSo you have learned\\nabout three types of data in python. We have numbers,\\nwhich can be\\nintegers or floats, we have booleans, and strings\\nThese are what we refer to as primitive or basic\\ntypes in\\npython. Now in python we have a bunch of complex\\ntypes as well\\nThese complex types are very useful in building real\\napplications\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about lists. We\\nuse lists whenever\\nwe want to represent a list of objects, like a list\\nof numbers, or a list of\\n\\nnames. Let me show you. So, I'm going to declare a\\nvariable\\ncalled names, and set it to a list of names. So here\\nwe add\\nsquare brackets to represent a list, and now we can\\nadd one or more\\nobjects inside this list. In this list we add a bunch\\nof names\\nLike John, Bob, Mosh\\nSam, and Mary. So we separate these elements\\nthese items using a comma. Now, let's print\\nour list, so print names, take a look\\nit comes out exactly like how we wrote it. Now we can\\nalso get individual elements in this list. For\\nexample, if you want to get\\nthe first element in this list, here we type a pair\\nof square brackets\\nand inside the square brackets, we type an index\\nThe index of the first element in this list is 0, so\\nnow, when we run\\nthis program, we're going to see John on the\\nterminal. There you go\\nNow, in python we can also use a negative index\\nThis is a feature that I personally have not seen in\\nother programming languages\\n\\nSo, if 0 represents the first element in this list\\nwhat do you think negative 1 represents?\\nIt represents the last element in this list. Let's\\nverify it\\nSo, let's run the program, and here's Mary. What\\nabout\\nnegative 2? Well, that represents\\nthe second element from the end of the list\\nSo, let's run the program, and here's Sam. Now we can\\nalso\\nchange an object at a given index. For example, let's\\nsay here we made a\\nmistake, and this John should not be spelled with an\\nh\\nSo, we need to reset it. We type names of 0\\nnow we treat this like a regular variable, so we set\\nit to a new value\\nWe set it to John without an h. Now let's\\nprint our list, and here's our updated list.\\nBeautiful\\nWe can also select a range of values. For example\\nlet's say we're only interested in the first three\\nnames\\nSo over here, we type square brackets, and here we\\n\\nneed to type\\ntwo indexes, a start index, and an end index\\nOur start index is a 0, because we want to start from\\nhere, and\\nour end index is going to be 0, 1, 2\\nplus 1, that's going to be 3. So, we add a\\ncolon, 3. So Python is going to return all the\\nelements\\nfrom the start index up to the end index, but\\nexcluding the\\nend index. So it's going to return the elements at\\nindex 0\\n1, and 2. Take a look\\nHere are the first three names. And by the way\\nthis expression does not modify our original list\\nit returns a new list. So, right after this print\\nstatement\\nif we print our original list\\nyou can see that it's not changed. So, this is how we\\nuse\\nlists in Python\\nEarlier I told you that strings in Python are\\nobjects. Objects in\\nprogramming are kind of like objects in the real\\n\\nworld. Like your mobile phone, your bicycle\\nthe remote control of your tv and so on. They have\\ncertain capabilities\\nSo if you type a string here, and then press dot\\nwe can see all the functions or methods available in\\na string object\\nin Python. Now, lists are also objects, so they have\\na bunch\\nof methods for adding items or removing them and so\\non. Let me show you\\nSo I'm going to declare a list of numbers, let's say\\n1, 2\\n3, 4, and 5. Now, to add a new element at the end\\nof this list, we can use the append method. So we\\ntype numbers\\ndot append, and here we type 6\\nNow, let's print our list\\nso here's our updated list. Beautiful. Now what if\\nyou want to\\ninsert a number somewhere in the middle or at the\\nbeginning. For that\\nuse the insert method. So, we're going to call\\nthe insert method, now on the top, go to the view\\nmenu\\nand look at parameter info. Look at the\\n\\nshortcut. On a Mac computer, it's command and p\\nOn Windows, it's probably control and p. If we use\\nthis shortcut\\nwe can see the values that this method expects\\nSo, the first value that this method expects is an\\nindex value\\nand the type of this value is an integer. So if I\\nwant to insert a value\\nat the beginning of this list, I should pass 0 as the\\nindex of the\\nfirst element, right? So let's pass 0. Now\\nthe second value is highlighted. So the second value\\nis an object\\nand the type of this is t. That basically means this\\ncan be\\nany type. We can pass a number, we can pass a\\nboolean, we can pass a string\\nwe can pass a list, or any type of objects in Python.\\nSo\\nI'm going to pass negative 1, now let's run our\\nprogram\\nyou can see negative 1 appeared at the beginning of\\nour list\\nWe also have a method for removing items. So, let's\\ncall\\n\\nremove 3. Let's run the program\\n3 is gone, we only have 1, 2, 4, and 5\\nNow if you want to remove all the items in the list,\\nwe call the clear method\\nSo clear, this method doesn't expect any values\\nSo let's run our program, our list is empty\\nNow sometimes you want to know if a given item exists\\nin our list or not. To do that\\nwe use the in operator. So, let's remove this line\\ninstead of printing our numbers list, I'm going to\\nprint an expression\\n1 in numbers\\nSo here we're using the in operator, we're checking\\nto see if 1 is\\nin the numbers list. So this is a boolean expression,\\nit returns a boolean\\nvalue. Take a look. So, we get true\\nObviously if you search for a value that doesn't\\nexist in this list\\nlike 10, we get false. Now finally\\nthere are times you want to know how many items you\\nhave in a list. To do that\\nyou can use the built in len function. So, let's\\nprint\\n\\nlen of numbers. So len\\nis a built in function, just like the print function,\\nthat is why it's highlighted\\nas purple. It returns the number of elements in a\\nlist. Take a look\\nSo we have 5 elements in this list\\nWhen writing Python programs, there are times\\nyou want to iterate over a list, and access each item\\nindividually\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to declare a list of\\nnumbers\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, now if we print this list\\nit comes out exactly like how we wrote it. Using the\\nsquare bracket notation. But what if we wanted to\\nprint each item on a separate line?\\nThat is where we use the for loop. Let me show you.\\nSo\\nwe're not going to print the entire list, instead\\nwe're going to type 4\\nnow we declare a variable which is called a loop\\nvariable\\nLet's call it item. Then we type in\\nnumbers, next we add a colon to start a block of code\\nSo this is what we call a for loop. With this for\\nloop\\n\\nwe can iterate over all the items in this list. In\\neach iteration\\nthis item variable is going to hold one value. So in\\nthe\\nfirst iteration, item is going to be equal to 1, and\\nthe second iteration is going to be\\nequal to 2, and so on. So, now if we print item\\nand run our program, we see each item on a new line\\nSo this is how you use a for loop. Now we could also\\nachieve the same thing using a while loop, but our\\ncode would be a little bit longer\\nLet me show you. So, we would have to start by\\ndeclaring a\\nloop variable outside of our while loop, let's say i,\\nwe set it to\\n0, now we say while i is less than\\nhere we need to find out how many items we have in\\nthis list. So\\nwe use the len function, len of numbers\\nSo as long as i is less than the length of the list\\nprint, now we can use the square bracket notation to\\nget the\\nelement at this index. So, numbers\\nof i. Now, we need to increment\\n\\ni by 1, so i equals i plus 1\\nLet's run the program and see what we get\\nSo we get the numbers 1 to 5, these are coming out\\nfrom our for loop\\nand then we get the numbers 1 to 5 one more time,\\nthese are coming out from\\nour while loop. Now if you compare these two\\napproaches, you can definitely see\\nthat the implementation using the for loop is shorter\\nand easier to understand\\nWe don't have to use the square bracket notation, we\\ndon't have to call\\nthe len function, we don't have to declare a\\nvariable, a loop variable\\nand then increment it explicitly, so with the for\\nloop\\nin each iteration, the item variable will\\nautomatically hold one value\\nin this list\\nIn this\\ntutorial, we're going to talk about the range\\nfunction in Python. We use the range\\nfunction to generate a sequence of numbers. Let me\\nshow you. So\\ntype range, this is a built in function, just like\\n\\nthe print and\\ninput functions, here we can pass a value like 5, and\\nthis will return\\na range object. A range object is an object that can\\nstore a sequence of numbers. Let me show you. So\\nlet's call that numbers, so this is a range object,\\nin this\\nobject we're going to have the numbers 0 to 5, but\\nexcluding 5\\nNow, if we print numbers\\nwe're going to see this message, range\\nof 0 to 5, not the actual numbers, because this is\\nthe default representation\\nof a range object. To see the actual numbers, we need\\nto iterate over\\nthis range object using a for loop. In the last video\\nyou learned\\nhow to iterate over a list using a for loop, but we\\ncan also iterate over a\\nrange object using a for loop. Basically we can use\\nthe for loop with\\nany object that represents a sequence of objects. So\\ninstead of printing numbers, we're going to use a for\\nloop\\nfor number, in numbers\\n\\ncolon, we're going to print number\\nTake a look. Now we see the numbers, 0\\nto 4. So, range of 5\\ngenerates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to\\nthe number\\nwe specify here. Now if we supply two values\\nthe first value is going to be considered the\\nstarting value, and\\nthe second value is going to be considered the ending\\nvalue and it's going to be excluded\\nSo range of 5 to 10 is going to generate the numbers\\n5 to\\n9. Take a look. There you go\\nNow we can also supply a third value, and that will\\nbe used as a step\\nSo let's say, instead of having a sequence of numbers\\nlike 5, 6\\n7, 8, 9, we want to jump two numbers at a time. So 5\\n7, 9 and so on. So here we pass 2 as the step\\nTake a look. So we get these odd numbers\\n5, 7, and 9. So this is the range\\nfunction in Python. Like quite often, you see the\\nrange function used as\\n\\npart of a for loop, because we don't really need to\\nstore the result in a separate\\nvariable, we can call the range function right here,\\nwhere we are\\nusing the numbers variable. So we can type range of 5\\nand this will return a range object holding the\\nnumbers 0 to 4\\nTake a look. There you go. So, we don't really need\\nto store the result in a separate variable like\\nnumbers\\nThere you go\\nIn this tutorial, we're going to talk about tuples in\\nPython. Tuples are\\nkind of like lists, we use them to store a sequence\\nof objects, but\\ntuples are immutable, which means we cannot change\\nthem once we create them\\nLet me show you. So I'm going to start by defining a\\nlist of numbers\\n1, 2, 3, now we use square brackets to define a list\\nand parenthesis to define a tuple. So now, this\\nnumbers variable is storing a tuple. If we try\\nto reassign, let's say the first element, we're going\\nto get an error\\nTuple object does not support item assignment\\n\\nSo this is what I meant by tuples are immutable,\\nthey're\\nunchangeable. Also, if we type\\nnumbers dot, you don't see any methods like append\\ninsert, remove, and so on. We only have count and\\nindex\\nCount returns the number of occurrences of an\\nelement, for example\\nif we have, let's say, two 3's in this tuple\\nand call count of 3, this will return 2\\nThe other method we have here is index, and this\\nreturns\\nthe index of the first occurrence of the given\\nelement\\nNow, these other methods you see here that start with\\nan underscore, they're\\ncalled magic methods. It's an advanced topic, and\\nI've covered it in detail\\nin my complete Python programming course. If you're\\ninterested, the link is\\ndown below this video. So, tuples are immutable, we\\ncannot\\nchange them once we create them. Now practically\\nspeaking, most of the time\\nyou would be using lists, but there are times that\\n\\nonce you create a list of objects\\nyou want to make sure that somewhere in your program,\\nyou or someone else is not going to\\naccidentally modify that list. If that's the case,\\nthen you should use\\na tuple\\nIn case you're interested, the link is below this\\nvideo\\n\"]], 'uris': None, 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[None]], 'distances': [[1.101739525794983]], 'included': [<IncludeEnum.distances: 'distances'>, <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>, <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}\n",
